This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the slurm program written
by the authors listed below.

This package was put together by by Gennaro Oliva <oliva.g@na.icar.cnr.it> 
from the sources available at 
	ftp://ftp.llnl.gov/pub/linux/slurm/

As Debian already contained a different source and binary package called
'slurm', this package has been renamed to 'slurm-llnl'.
